- Benzodiazepines exert qualitatively similar clinical effects, but quantitative differences in their pharmacodynamic spectra and pharmacokinetic properties have led to varying patterns of therapeutic application.
- Benzodiazepine-like effects are classified as full agonistic effects (i.e., faithfully mimicking agents such as diazepam with relatively low fractional occupancy of binding sites) Benzodiazepines inhibit some types of seizure activity.
- Tolerance occurs to the muscle relaxant and ataxic effects of these drugs.
- Benzodiazepine administration typically increases total sleep time, largely because of increased time spent in stage 2.
- Zolpidem and zaleplon suppress REM sleep to a lesser extent and thus may be superior to benzodiazepiners for use as hypnotics.
- The remarkable safety of the benzodiazepines is likely related to the fact that their effects in vivo depend on the presynaptic release of GABA.
- A pure antagonist (e.g., flumazenil) acting alone at this binding site does not affect GABAA-receptor function but can reverse the effects of high doses of Benzodiazepine.
- Inhibitory effects on muscular hypertonia or the spread of seizure activity can be rationalized by potentiation of GABA-ergic circuits.
- Benzodiazepines may worsen sleep-related breathing disorders by adversely affecting control of the upper airway muscles or by decreasing the ventilatory response to CO2.
- In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, hypnotic doses may exaggerate the impact of apneic episodes on alveolar hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac ventricular load.
- Some benzodiazepines are biotransformed more slowly than are the parent compounds.
- duration of action bears little relationship to the t1/2 of elimination of the drug that has been administered.
- An ideal hypnotic agent would have a rapid onset of action when taken at bedtime and a sufficiently sustained action to facilitate sleep throughout the night.
- Benzodiazepine use poses a risk for development of dependence and abuse.
- Abuse of benzodiazepines includes the use of flunitrazepam (ROHYPNOL) as a “date-rape” drug.
- Withdrawal symptoms may include temporary intensification of the problems that originally prompted their use (e.g., insomnia or anxiety) Flumazenil (ROMAZICON) is an imidazobenzodiazepine that behaves as a specific benzodiazepines antagonist.
- The drug antagonizes both the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of agonist and inverseagonist benzidiazepines and b-carbolines.
- Tolerance and physical dependence develop only rarely.
- An extended-release formulation of zolpidem (AMBIEN CR) is now marketed in the U.S.
